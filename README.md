# Readability Score
Command Line application - JetBrains Academy Project

## About
An application design that evaluates the difficulty level of a specific complex user input. The application is able to assess, presumably, to what age the sent text should be understood (in the age range). The application also determines the number of sentences, characters, syllables and polysyllables in the text - using string and regex operations. Calculating functions use, among other things, the standard Math library.
